# project aim and description:

Crammer Education have been increasingly busy since the pandemic. Lockdowns and changes in the way that we live our lives have lead to an increased demand for remote learning that is effective, enjoyable, and accessible. Crammer are keen to grow their customer base and would like you to design and build a product that they can add to their existing portfolio of apps that will support students across the country with their revision.

Our aim with this project has been to create an all in one organisational and revision tool for help students properly plan their studyloads and make that studying simpler and more effective. We have created a website where you can utilise several organisation tools on the dashboard to make better use of yor time. We have also created a note taker that allows you to embed an educational video, and view it as you create notes on the subject you are studying. You are also able to create timestamps of specific moments you might like to return to.

# Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, Axios, Vite and Vitest, GSAP, SemanticUI, Webflow, Figma, Trello and Git/Github.

# Process:

We began by creating brainstorming the functionality we wish to be included, followed by lo-fi and hi-fi designs utilising figma. Following this we began the process of designing the database to store the necessary information, before moving onto creating the necessary structure for both the front and back ends. We created a components tree to help us design how we would divide the components up and have them work together. Finally we added front and back end testing and tightened up the design to fit new needs and inspirations as and when they arose.
