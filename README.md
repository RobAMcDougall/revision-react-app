# project aim and description:

Crammer Education have been increasingly busy since the pandemic. Lockdowns and changes in the way that we live our lives have lead to an increased demand for remote learning that is effective, enjoyable, and accessible. Crammer are keen to grow their customer base and would like you to design and build a product that they can add to their existing portfolio of apps that will support students across the country with their revision.

Our aim with this project has been to create an all in one organisational and revision tool for help students properly plan their studyloads and make that studying simpler and more effective. We have created a website where you can utilise several organisation tools on the dashboard to make better use of yor time. We have also created a note taker that allows you to embed an educational video, and view it as you create notes on the subject you are studying. You are also able to create timestamps of specific moments you might like to return to.
